# Soevnn
Soevnn is an acronym for Self-Organising Estimated-Variance Neural Net. It is consists of neurons connected in a directed graph. The neurons are not pre-organized into layers. Each neuron learns an estimated expectation of it's combined inputs.

Also included is a console program to facilitate training, testing, and analysis of individual Soevnn's. 

Please note, this has been a solo project up to this point. As such my current priority is adding documentation, improving code readability, completing the help system for the console program, correcting any in-code misspellings that I might not have bothered to fix, etc.
