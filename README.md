# Soevnn
Soevnn is an acronym for Self-Organising Estimated-Variance Neural Net. It is consists a heterogeneous population of neurons connected in a directed cyclic graph. Instead of being pre-organized into specific layers, the neurons are organized into structures, types, and clusters. The neurons form connections probabilisticly based on a variety of factors. Neurons will also break less useful connections. Each neuron learns short-term and long-term estimated expectations of it's combined inputs. The output is the comparison of the short-term expectation relative to the long-term expectation.

Also included is a console program to facilitate training, testing, and analysis of individual Soevnns.
